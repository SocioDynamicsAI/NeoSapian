# 🧠 Neosapians Foundation Model

> Building the **next Linux of AI** — an open, community-governed foundation model.

---

## 🌍 Mission
To build a **fully open-source, auditable, and community-driven foundation model** that advances AI for global benefit — just as Linux did for operating systems.

## 🧱 Core Principles
- **Open by default:** Every line of code, model weight, and dataset manifest is transparent.
- **Reproducibility:** Every release includes training configs, random seeds, and environment details.
- **Responsible data:** Only uses ethically sourced, license-compliant datasets.
- **Meritocratic governance:** Decisions made via open discussion, not gatekeeping.
